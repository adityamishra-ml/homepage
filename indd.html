       Traffic signboard recognition (TSR) is crucial and has wide range of applications including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), 
       autonomous driving, navigation and smart city infrastructure. However, TSR at night-time and in low-light conditions is difficult due to variety of
       inherent noises: brightness, motion blur, light glare, occlusion, etc. Also, there do not a exist a public dataset for night-time, to cater this we 
       curated the INDD, a heavily night-time dataset and benchmarked it with strong baselines and existing state-of-the-art models.

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify; color: var(--text-light);">
       The INDD consists of 6004 night-time images with 14044 instances of signboards spanning over a carefully curated set of 41 classes. The dataset spans
       across six different cities, includes both rural and urban signboards, and also features different lightening conditions based on the availibilty of 
       street lights and different time of the night. The dataset also consist of "tampered" class that features vandalised, broken, rusted or covered with
       pamphelets. To solve low-to-high quality or night-to-day traffic/driving scene image-to-image translation, we also parition the data based on the 
       image quality (taken from smartphone or low-budget action camera) and an additonal set of day images along the same routes.
